# User Inputs Required

-   Update `mWater_API_placeholder` to have the correct API url and rename the file to `mWater_API.yml`
-   Have Katie Willi or Matt Ross run the `budget_downloader.Rmd` script to get up to date job code data
-   Change the month and year in the chunk below to the month you are looking for

Once these are done, you can go to the section "Run Above..." to tidy data for user review

```{r}
###### ------ MONTH AND YEAR SELECTOR ------ ######
